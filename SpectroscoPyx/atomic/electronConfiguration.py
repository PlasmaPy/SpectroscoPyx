Class for describing electron configuration for an ion. This will be
used with the term symbol to give a full description of the
energy state of an ion. Two such energy states then define a transition.
There will be a converter function which converts between this class
object description and spectroscopic notation as found in databases
such as NIST.


TODO:
    -add square bracket functionality NIST
    - __bool__ behavior for configurations, terms, energies, etc
    -include L-S coupling
    -include functions/methods without L-S coupling assumption
    -include jj coupling scheme methods
    -use subshellConfiguration() in electronConfiguration()
    -use electronConfiguration() and termSymbol() for energyLevel()
    -use 2 energyLevel() objects for transition() object
    -Create system for managing/saving/converting list of transition() objs
    -add "selection rules" tests for allowed/forbidden transitions

# multiplicity (singlet, doublet, triplet, etc)
"""
multiplicity = 2(S+1)
where S = total spin angular momentum, determined by the total spin of
unpaired electrons. Electrons which are already paired in an orbital are
of opposite spin and therefore cancel out.
multiplicity = 1  singlet
multiplicity = 2  doublet
multiplicity = 3  triplet
multiplicity = 4  quartet
multiplicity = 5  quintet

The number of levels is further determined by the azimuthal quantum number
as well. When S <= L the multiplicity equals the number of spin orientations,
but when S > L there are only 2L+1 orientations of total angular momentum
possible (where total angular momentum is J = L + S). 

example:
    S = 3/2 (3 unpaired electrons)
    2S +1 = 4 (quartet)
    For an S state, L = 0
    S can range from -S to + S in integer steps, but L is fixed, and J must
    be positive. So only possible value of J is J = 0 + 3/2, and there is
    only one level even though multiplicity is 4.
    
Note that electrons will first fill empty orbitals, so it should be easy to
calculate the number of unpaired electrons, and therefore the  multiplicity.


One way to get multiplicity is to take total # of possible electrons in 
a subshell and divide it by 2 (which then equals 2l+1).
With nElec being the total number of electrons in a subshell...
if nElec <= 2l+1:
    # no electrons are paired
    S = nElec * 1/2
elif nElec > 2l+1:
    # some electrons will be paired, but how many?
    paired = nElec - 2l+1
    # S is then nElec, less the paired electrons, times 1/2
    S = (nElec - 2*paired) * 1/2
    # reducing, which is just the maximum electrons in the subshell, less
    # the total number of present electrons. This works because the empty
    # spots tell us there are unpaird electrons, since over half the
    # subshell is filled!
    S = (2(2l+1) - nElec) * 1/2
