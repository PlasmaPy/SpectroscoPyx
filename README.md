**Note: development on SpectroscoPyx is currently suspended.**

An open source community developed Python 3.6+ package for spectroscopy in the early stages of development. The focus is on atomic spectroscopy with applications for plasma spectroscopy. SpectroscoPyx intends to be for spectroscopy what
[Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy) is for astronomy - a 
collection of commonly used programs to be shared between spectroscopists 
and researchers globally, running within and leveraging the open source 
scientific Python ecosystem. 

Goals include:
* Creating a generalized syntax for describing atomic energy levels and transitions
* Creating a single interface for multiple spectroscopic databases (e.g., NIST, CHIANTI), opacity databases, and lineshape databases
* Maintaining a system of unique identifiers to precisely share and cite which databases and versions were used for a particular analysis run
* Generating tools convenient for common tasks in simulation and analysis of spectroscopic data
* Creating a spectroscopic simulation suite which can use the aforementioned interfaces to readily compare spectra generated using different databases

We created a guide on
[contributing to SpectroscoPyx](CONTRIBUTING.md) and have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
New contributors are very welcome! 

We are in the process of writing [online documentation](http://spectroscopyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation

We're not on PyPI or Conda yet, but we're working on it!

To install the development verison follow the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Like most scientific Python packages, PlasmaPy probably runs best on the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads).

SpectroscoPyx requires Python 3.6 and is
[not compatible with Python 2](https://pythonclock.org/).
